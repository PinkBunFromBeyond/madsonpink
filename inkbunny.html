				<p>The inkbunny gallery is home to the most extreme content of all my galleries. Why did I choose to post it there? Because it gives me a little more control on how my content get consumed compared to other sites (mainly the ability to put two walls of thumbnail before the actual piece is shown). With this in mind I ask you to visit the following site with an open but alert mind.
				<br>
				I know minors will eventually find a way to bypass any and all walls I put before my content and if you're one of those minor, and are still solid in your decision to see what's ahead, I ask that you take a moment first to consider that what you're about to see is meant to be fantasy and only fantasy, in no way related to real life HEALTHY sex life. If you, or any other minor you know, has been part of similar scenarios while still under the age of maturity you'll find at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VFKVgZYXNAhrdChT7bOz2yZdZDWWepixmH1oyIC4Vsg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">THIS LINK</a> useful numbers and links to organizations that I beg you to contact. 
				<br><br>
				Please remember that clear of mind consent is an imperative rule for any healthy real life sex scenarios. But also remember that what is fantasy should never be considered a fact, as to not repeat history and use the excuse of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art" target="_blank">Degenerate Art</a> to create another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Diana" target="_blank">Mike Diana</a>.

				If you agree to all of the above you'll find the link to my IB gallery by clicking the word take on the title.</p>
